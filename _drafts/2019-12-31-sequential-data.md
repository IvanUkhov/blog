How hard can it be to ingest sequential data into a [TensorFlow] model? As
always, the answer is, “It depends.” Where are the sequences stored? Can they
fit in the main memory? Are they of the same length? In what follows, we shall
start with [BigQuery] as our data warehouse and show how to channel sequential
observations into a TensorFlow graph in a flexible, scalable fashion.
