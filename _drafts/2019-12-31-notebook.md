It is truly amazing how [IPython] and later [Project Jupyter] have
revolutionized the way we interact with data, especially at early exploratory
stages. Where would data enthusiasts be without interactive notebooks, which are
ubiquitous and taken for granted now-a-days? Most likely, we would be spending
way too much time staring at a terminal window, anxiously re-running scripts
from start to finish, printing variables, and saving lots of files with tables
and graphs on disk for further inspection. In this article, we shall make
[JupyterLab] and [RStudio] readily available at our disposal with our
preferences set up and favorite packages installed, no matter where we find
ourselves working and regardless of the mess we might have left during the
previous working session.

Python and R (in alphabetic order) are arguably the primary go-to tools of data
scientists.
