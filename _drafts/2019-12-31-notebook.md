It is truly amazing how [IPython] and then [Project Jupyter] have revolutionized
the way people interact with data and, in general, perform interactive
computations, especially at early exploratory stages. Where would data
enthusiasts be without interactive notebooks, which are ubiquitous and
considered given now-a-days? Most likely, we would be spending way too much time
in a terminal, anxiously re-running scripts from start to finish, printing
variables into the standard output, and saving lots of files with tables and
graphs on disk for further inspection.
