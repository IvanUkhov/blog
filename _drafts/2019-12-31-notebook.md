It is truly amazing how interactive notebooks—where narratives in spoken
languages are entwined with executable chunks of code in programming
languages—have revolutionized the way we work with data and document our thought
processes and findings for others and, equally importantly, for our future
selves. They are ubiquitous and taken for granted. It is hard to imagine where
data enthusiasts would be without them. Most likely, we would be spending way
too much time staring at a terminal window, anxiously re-running scripts from
start to finish, printing variables, and saving lots of files with tables and
graphs on disk for further inspection. Interactive notebooks are an essential
tool in the data scientist’s toolbox, and in this article, we shall make them
readily available with our preferences set up and our favorite packages
installed, no matter where we find ourselves working and regardless of the mess
we might have left behind during the previous session.

Python and R (in alphabetic order) are arguably the primary languages used by
data scientists now-a-days. In the context of interactive computation, [IPython]
and later on [Project Jupyter] have been of paramount importance for the Python
community (although the latter is language agnostic). In the R community, this
role is played by [RStudio]. Therefore, having at our disposal [JupyterLab],
which is Project Jupyter’s flagship, and RStudio should cover the vast majority
of use cases.
