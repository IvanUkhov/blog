It is truly amazing how [IPython] and later on [Project Jupyter] have
revolutionized the way we interact with data and, in general, perform
interactive computations. Interactive notebooks, where executable chunks of code
in a programming language are entwined with a narrative in a spoken language,
are ubiquitous and taken for granted now-a-days. Where would data enthusiasts be
without them? Most likely, we would be spending way too much time staring at a
terminal window, anxiously re-running scripts from start to finish, printing
variables, and saving lots of files with tables and graphs on disk for further
inspection. Interactive notebooks are an essential tool in the data scientistâ€™s
toolbox, and in this article, we shall make [JupyterLab] and [RStudio] readily
available at our disposal with our preferences set up and favorite packages
installed, no matter where we find ourselves working and regardless of the mess
we might have left during the previous working session.

Python and R (in alphabetic order) are arguably the primary go-to tools of data
scientists.
