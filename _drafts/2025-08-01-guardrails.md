Suppose you run several online stores, and their number keeps on growing. It is
becoming increasingly difficult to monitor the performance of any given one as
there are simply too many of them. There is a fair chance that something
unexpected happens, and that it will have a negative impact on either the
website traffic or the conversion rateâ€”without you realizing it. To stay
vigilant, it might be prudent to have guardrails in place that would inform you
when something goes wrong. In this article, we shall take a look at how to build
such guardrails using Bayesian statistics.
