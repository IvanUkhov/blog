Hello,

I am Ivan, the author of this blog. I am passionate about statistics and machine
learning, and writing here is a way for me to learn and to share what I learn.

On a more professional note, I received a Ph.D. degree in computer science from
Link√∂ping University in 2017. My [research] was mainly focused on uncertainty
quantification in the context of electronic systems, which one can read more
about in my doctoral [thesis]. At the moment, I work as a senior data scientist
at a gaming tech company based in Stockholm.

Please do not hesitate to reach out, and thank you for stopping by.

Sincerely yours,<br/>Ivan
