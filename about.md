Hello,

I am Ivan, the author of this blog. I am passionate about probability theory,
statistics, and machine learning, and writing here is a way for me to learn and
to share what I learn.

On a more professional note, I received a Ph.D. degree in computer science from
Link√∂ping University in 2017. My [research] was mainly focused on uncertainty
quantification in the context of electronic systems, which one can find out more
about in the [dissertation]. At the moment, I work as a data scientist at a
gaming tech company based in Stockholm.

Do not hesitate to reach out, and thanks for stopping by!

Sincerely yours,<br/>Ivan
