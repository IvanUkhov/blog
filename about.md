Hi there!

I am Ivan, the author of this blog. I am passionate about probability theory,
statistics, machine learning, and related disciplines. I received a Ph.D. degree
in computer science from Link√∂ping University in 2017. My [thesis] work was
focused on quantifying uncertainty in the context of electronic systems. At the
moment, I work as a data science at a gaming tech company based in Stockholm.

I also enjoy [taking pictures][photography] from time to time.

Sincerely yours,<br/>Ivan
