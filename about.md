Hi there!

I am Ivan, the author of this blog. I am passionate about probability theory,
statistics, machine learning, and related disciplines. I received a Ph.D. degree
in computer science from Link√∂ping University in 2017. My [research] was mainly
focused on quantifying uncertainty in the context of electronic systems, which
one can read more about in the [thesis]. At the moment, I work as a data science
at a gaming tech company based in Stockholm. I also enjoy [taking
pictures][photography].

Sincerely yours,<br/>Ivan
