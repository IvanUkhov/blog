Hello,

I am Ivan, the author of this blog. I enjoy software engineering, statistics,
and machine learning, and writing here is a way for me to learn; hopefully, it
can be of interest to others as well.

On a more professional note, I received a Ph.D. degree in computer science from
Linköping University in 2017. My [research] was focused on uncertainty
quantification in the context of electronic systems, which one can read more
about in my doctoral [dissertation][thesis]. In 2018, I left academia and have
been working in industry since then. More information about my education and
career can be found in my [résumé][resume].

Please feel free to reach out. Thank you!

Sincerely yours,<br/>Ivan
