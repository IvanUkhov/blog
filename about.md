Hello,

I am Ivan, the author of this blog. I am passionate about statistics, machine
learning, and data science, and writing here is a way for me to learn and to
share what I learn.

On a more professional note, I received a Ph.D. degree in computer science from
Linköping University in 2017. My [research] was mainly focused on uncertainty
quantification in the context of electronic systems, which one can read more
about in my doctoral [dissertation][thesis]. Since early 2018, I have been
working as a data scientist and a machine learning engineer at tech companies
based in Stockholm. For more information, please refer to my [résumé][resume].

Please feel free to reach out. Thank you!

Sincerely yours,<br/>Ivan
