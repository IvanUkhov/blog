        <a class="post-link" href="/2024/01/31/gradient-accumulation.html">
          Out of memory, or gradient accumulation for larger models
        </a>
      </h3><p>When the model grows large and does not fit on a single device, the common
mitigation strategy is to reduce the batch size, thereby allowing more space for
the model at the expense of the data. However, smaller batches lead to noisier
weight updates, which is undesirable. One solution is gradient accumulation
where the weights are updated after evaluating the gradients for several batches
at a time. In this article, we show how it can be implemented in practice.</p>

        <a class="post-link" href="/2024/01/17/relative-positional-embedding.html">
          Relative positional embedding for any attention mechanism
        </a>
      </h3><p>In <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1803.02155">Shaw et al. (2018)</a>, the authors introduce relative positional embedding for
self-attention in transformer models, and in <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1809.04281">Huang et al. (2018)</a>, the authors
present a memory efficient approach to calculating this embedding in decoder
blocks, in which the self-attention is causal. In this article, the approach is
generalized to any attention mechanism, should it be self or cross or full or
causal.</p>

        <a class="post-link" href="/2021/01/25/dirichlet-process.html">
          Breaking sticks, or estimation of probability distributions using the Dirichlet process
        </a>
      </h3><p>Recall the last time you wanted to understand the distribution of given data.
One alternative was to plot a histogram. However, it resulted in frustration due
to the choice of the number of bins to use, which led to drastically different
outcomes. Another alternative was kernel density estimation. Despite having a
similar choice to make, it has the advantage of producing smooth estimates,
which are more realistic for continuous quantities with regularities. However,
kernel density estimation was unsatisfactory too: it did not aid in
understanding the underlying structure of the data and, moreover, provided no
means of quantifying the uncertainty associated with the results. In this
article, we discuss a Bayesian approach to the estimation of data-generating
distributions that addresses the aforementioned concerns.</p>

        <a class="post-link" href="/2020/06/22/gaussian-process.html">
          Heteroscedastic Gaussian process regression
        </a>
      </h3><p>Gaussian process regression is a nonparametric Bayesian technique for modeling
relationships between variables of interest. The vast flexibility and rigor
mathematical foundation of this approach make it the default choice in many
problems involving small- to medium-sized data sets. In this article, we
illustrate how Gaussian process regression can be utilized in practice. To make
the case more compelling, we consider a setting where linear regression would be
inadequate. The focus will be <em>not</em> on getting the job done as fast as possible
but on learning the technique and understanding the choices being made.</p>

        <a class="post-link" href="/2020/04/10/comparison.html">
          What is the easiest way to compare two data sets?
        </a>
      </h3><p>One has probably come across this problem numerous times. There are two versions
of a tabular data set with a lot of columns of different types, and one wants to
quickly identify any differences between the two. For example, the pipeline
providing data to a predictive model might have been updated, and the goal is to
understand if there have been any side effects of this update for the training
data.</p>

        <a class="post-link" href="/2020/02/03/net-promoter.html">
          Bayesian inference of the net promoter score via multilevel regression with poststratification
        </a>
      </h3><p>Customer surveys are naturally prone to biases. One prominent example is
participation bias, which arises when individuals decide not to respond to the
survey, and this pattern is not random. For instance, new customers might reply
less eagerly than those who are senior. This renders the obtained responses
unrepresentative of the target population. In this article, we tackle
participation bias for the case of the net promoter survey by means of
multilevel regression and poststratification.</p>

        <a class="post-link" href="/2019/11/08/sequential-data.html">
          Ingestion of sequential data from BigQuery into TensorFlow
        </a>
      </h3><p>How hard can it be to ingest sequential data into a <a href="https://www.tensorflow.org">TensorFlow</a> model? As
always, the answer is, “It depends.” Where are the sequences in question stored?
Can they fit in main memory? Are they of the same length? In what follows, we
shall build a flexible and scalable workflow for feeding sequential observations
into a TensorFlow graph starting from <a href="https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/">BigQuery</a> as the data warehouse.</p>

        <a class="post-link" href="/2019/09/25/bootstrap.html">
          Sample size determination using historical data and simulation
        </a>
      </h3><p>In order to test a hypothesis, one has to design and execute an adequate
experiment. Typically, it is neither feasible nor desirable to involve the whole
population. Instead, a relatively small subset of the population is studied, and
given the outcome for this small sample, relevant conclusions are drawn with
respect to the population. An important question to answer is then, What is the
minimal sample size needed for the experiment to succeed? In what follows, we
answer this question using solely historical data and computer simulation,
without invoking any classical statistical procedures.</p>

        <a class="post-link" href="/2019/08/19/net-promoter.html">
          A Bayesian approach to the inference of the net promoter score
        </a>
      </h3><p>The net promoter score is a widely adopted metric for gauging customers’
satisfaction with a product. The popularity of the score is arguably attributed
to the simplicity of measurement and the intuitiveness of interpretation.
Moreover, it is claimed to be correlated with revenue growth, which, ignoring
causality, makes it even more appealing. In this article, we leverage Bayesian
statistics in order to infer the net promoter score for an arbitrary
segmentation of a customer base. The outcome of the inference is a distribution
over all possible values of the score weighted by probabilities, which provides
exhaustive information for the subsequent decision-making.</p>

        <a class="post-link" href="/2019/07/24/notebook.html">
          Interactive notebooks in tightly sealed disposable containers
        </a>
      </h3><p>It is truly amazing how interactive notebooks—where a narrative in a spoken
language is entwined with executable chunks of code in a programming
language—have revolutionized the way we work with data and document our thought
processes and findings for others and, equally importantly, for our future
selves. They are ubiquitous and taken for granted. It is hard to imagine where
data enthusiasts would be without them. Most likely, we would be spending too
much time staring at a terminal window, anxiously re-running scripts from start
to finish, printing variables, and saving lots of files with tables and graphs
on disk for further inspection. Interactive notebooks are an essential tool in
the data scientist’s toolbox, and in this article, we are going to make them
readily available for our use with our favorite packages installed and
preferences set up, no matter where we find ourselves working and regardless of
the mess we might have left behind during the previous session.</p>

      <h3>
        <a class="post-link" href="/2019/07/08/conversion.html">
          On the expected utility in conversion rate optimization
        </a>
      </h3><p>It can be not only extremely useful but also deeply satisfying to occasionally
dust off one’s math skills. In this article, we approach the classical problem
of conversion rate optimization—which is frequently faced by companies operating
online—and derive the expected utility of switching from variant A to variant B
under some modeling assumptions. This information can subsequently be utilized
in order to support the corresponding decision-making process.</p>

        <a class="post-link" href="/2019/07/01/orchestration.html">
          A poor man’s orchestration of predictive models, or do it yourself
        </a>
      </h3><p>As a data scientist focusing on developing data products, you naturally want
your work to reach its target audience. Suppose, however, that your company does
not have a dedicated engineering team for productizing data-science code. One
solution is to seek help in other teams, which are surely busy with their own
endeavors, and spend months waiting. Alternatively, you could take the
initiative and do it yourself. In this article, we take the initiative and
schedule the training and application phases of a predictive model using Apache
<a href="https://airflow.apache.org/">Airflow</a>, Google <a href="https://cloud.google.com/compute/">Compute Engine</a>, and <a href="https://www.docker.com/">Docker</a>.</p>
